## PyBites Platform Enterprise Tier

Keep your team engaged with [PyBites Code Challenges](http://codechalleng.es/)!

Coding daily in Python is key to keeping Python development skills sharp.

The _PyBites Code Challenges Enterprise Tier_ is designed to ensure your team keeps their Python skill up by challenging them with 300+ Python exercises (Bites). The Bites can be taken adhoc or via curated Learning Paths.

Such a varied range of exercises will not only keep your team interested but will also expose them to the many facets of Python.

Coding in your environment likely has your developers focused on one aspect of Python with very limited opportunity to learn outside of that environment.

PyBites Code Challenges solves this problem by giving them that mental break they need to stay engaged and fresh.

If that isn't enough, then the leaderboard system will encourage them to code regularly in healthy competition against their peers.

It wouldn't be an Enterprise product though without metrics. The dashboard for the account owner displays progress of all licence holders allowing admins to see when accounts are being underutilised.

> Regular coding practice outside of your normal work role is important to keep a learning mindset and to remain excited about being a software engineer. However, it's sometimes difficult to find time to work on a side project that really pushes you to learn. That's why I highly recommend PyBytes CodeChalleng.es platform. You can easily fit a few challenges a week into even a crazy schedule. The learning paths are a great way to focus your learning, but you can also just jump around and try new things. The team plan allows you to see who is participating, which is awesome. I've used this to encourage team members to keep pushing themselves to learn more, or to help someone who is running into difficulties. It's also fun to work on challenges in a group setting, mob programming style, and learn from each other. - Brian Okken
