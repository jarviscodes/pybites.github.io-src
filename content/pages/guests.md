<div id="geoff-riley">
    <h3><a name="geoff-riley"></a>Geoff Riley</h3>
    <p>With over 40 years experience, Geoff is a self proclaimed ancient programmer who often reminisces about the days when a single computer filled rooms and had less power than a modern washing machine. Professionally he has been involved with: data collection and statistical process analysis; recruitment payroll, and search and selection systems; and some database analysis. He has a large arsenal of programming languages at his disposal, having started with Basic (an interest main frame version) and moving through assembly code (Z-80 and 6502 initially) before taking up Pascal and C before getting into more scripting languages including Bash, Perl and, of course, Python when managing arrays of servers.</p>
    <p>Beyond computer based tasks, Geoff is also a skilled jewellery maker, model maker and (what the choir leader calls) a useful tenor in the local Anglican Church choir.</p>
